# Chapter 7: The Significance of Evidence

This chapter introduces **hypothesis testing** - a formal framework for making decisions based on data. We learn how to evaluate whether observed patterns are likely due to chance or represent real effects.

## Learning Objectives

After completing this chapter, you will be able to:

- Formulate null and alternative hypotheses
- Understand and compute p-values
- Conduct t-tests for comparing means
- Apply F-tests for comparing variances
- Use chi-square tests for categorical data
- Interpret statistical significance correctly
- Avoid common pitfalls (p-hacking, multiple testing)

## Chapter Outline

1. **Significance and P-Values** - The foundation of hypothesis testing
2. **Comparing Means** - t-tests for one and two samples
3. **Other Important Tests** - F-tests and chi-square tests
4. **Dangers and Pitfalls** - What can go wrong

## Why This Matters

Hypothesis testing is fundamental to:
- **Scientific Research**: Validating experimental findings
- **A/B Testing**: Making data-driven product decisions
- **Quality Control**: Detecting process changes
- **Medicine**: Evaluating treatment effectiveness
- **Machine Learning**: Comparing model performance

## The Big Question

> "Could this result have happened by chance?"

Hypothesis testing provides a rigorous framework for answering this question.
