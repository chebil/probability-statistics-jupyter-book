# Probability and Statistics for Computer Science

Welcome to this Jupyter Book companion for **"Probability and Statistics for Computer Science"** by David Forsyth.

## About This Book

This interactive Jupyter Book provides a comprehensive guide to probability and statistics tailored specifically for computer science students. The material emphasizes practical applications, computational approaches, and hands-on examples.

## Book Structure

The book is organized into four main parts:

### Part I: Describing Datasets
Learn how to visualize and summarize data using descriptive statistics, histograms, scatter plots, and correlation analysis.

### Part II: Probability
Explore fundamental concepts in probability theory, including discrete and continuous probability, random variables, expectations, and useful probability distributions.

### Part III: Inference
Understand statistical inference, including sampling, confidence intervals, hypothesis testing, experimental design, and both maximum likelihood and Bayesian approaches.

### Part IV: Tools
Master essential data science tools including PCA, classification algorithms, clustering methods, regression analysis, and Markov chains.

## Key Features

- **Interactive Examples**: Jupyter notebooks with executable Python code
- **Real Datasets**: Examples using publicly available datasets
- **Practical Focus**: Emphasis on computational approaches and simulation
- **Computer Science Applications**: Applications relevant to CS students and professionals

## How to Use This Book
