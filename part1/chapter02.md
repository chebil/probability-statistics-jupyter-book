# Chapter 2: Looking at Relationships

## Overview

Chapter 1 covered single variables (1D data). Now we explore relationships between two variables (2D data).

## Learning Objectives

- Create and interpret scatter plots
- Understand correlation and causation
- Calculate correlation coefficients
- Use correlation for prediction
- Recognize correlation pitfalls

## Why Study Relationships?

Real-world phenomena rarely exist in isolation:
- Height and weight
- Study time and grades
- Temperature and ice cream sales
- Years of experience and salary

## Chapter Contents

### [2.1 Plotting 2D Data](ch02_2d_data.md)
- Scatter plots
- Series plots
- Categorical visualizations

### [2.2 Correlation](ch02_correlation.md)
- Pearson correlation coefficient
- Interpreting correlation
- Prediction using correlation
- Common mistakes

## Key Concepts

**Scatter Plot**: Visual representation of relationship between two variables

**Correlation**: Statistical measure of linear relationship strength
- Range: -1 to +1
- Positive: variables increase together
- Negative: one increases, other decreases
- Zero: no linear relationship

**Important**: Correlation ≠ Causation!
