# Chapter 1: First Tools for Looking at Data

## Overview

The single most important question for a working scientist is: **"What's going on here?"**

This chapter introduces fundamental techniques for exploring and understanding datasets through visualization and summarization.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:
- Understand what datasets are and how they're structured
- Create effective visualizations (bar charts, histograms, scatter plots)
- Calculate and interpret descriptive statistics (mean, median, standard deviation)
- Use standard coordinates and recognize normal data
- Apply these tools to real-world datasets

## Key Concepts

- **Datasets**: Collections of observations or measurements
- **Visualization**: Making pictures of data to expose structure
- **Descriptive Statistics**: Numerical summaries of datasets
- **Distribution**: How data values are spread across possible values

- [1.2 Plotting Data](ch01_plotting.md)
- [1.3 Summarizing 1D Data](ch01_summarizing.md)

## Why This Matters

Before diving into complex statistical methods, you need to understand your data. Visualization and descriptive statistics are your first line of defense against:
- Hidden patterns
- Outliers
- Data quality issues
- Misleading conclusions
